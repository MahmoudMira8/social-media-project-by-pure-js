# social-media-project-by-pure-js
Welcome to the Social Media Project, a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a learning exercise for the developer and does not rely on any external libraries for JavaScript or CSS. As such, some parts of the code may not be fully optimized.

## Features
The Social Media Project includes a variety of features, such as:
* User login and registration
* Post creation, deletion, and editing
* Pagination for efficient data management
* Public profile pages displaying user information and allowing comments on posts

## Technical Details
This project utilizes Axios requests to communicate with the API provided by Coding Academy. Pagination has been implemented to manage large amounts of data retrieved from the API effectively.

## Getting Started
To begin exploring the Social Media Project, follow these steps:
1. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
2. Navigate to the login and registration pages to create an account or sign in.
3. Create new posts, view and edit existing posts, and explore other users' profiles.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this project is a personal training exercise, and some areas of the code may require improvement. Nonetheless, the Social Media Project serves as a solid foundation for anyone interested in building their own social media platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Contributing
As a software engineer, I encourage collaboration and welcome any suggestions or improvements to the code. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request on GitHub.
